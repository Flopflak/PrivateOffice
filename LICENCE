8. Disclaimer of Liability: The Author shall not be held liable for any damages, liability, or harm arising from the use, distribution, or misuse of the Software. You assume all risks associated with the use, distribution, or modification of the Software. The Author does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or suitability of the Software for any particular purpose.
